                    <h2 class="text-center" style="color: #8B4513;">Cord Management </h2>
                    <img src="https://aarchechon.com/image/stress-management4.png" alt="" class="onlyTabOrPhone">
                    <p>Cords are automatic energetic connections that develop between two people, often triggered at some point when your energy diverts from its original purpose to reach out to another. They are also referred to as 'psychic cords' or 'etheric cords.' The concept of energetic cords is closely associated with the importance of maintaining healthy boundaries in relationships. Some cords can be so subtle that we may not even be aware of their existence. However, an accumulation of cords from many people and the gradual depletion of energy over time may create an energy deficit. The nature of cords can be classified as healthy or unhealthy based on the impact they have on your energy system.</p>
                    <p>A healthy and positive cord provides stability and peace in your life, ensuring that you take care of yourself and others with love, support, and connection. Conversely, an unhealthy or negative cord may transmit negative emotions or energy, leaving you emotionally unstable, drained, and overly dependent on your partner's or person's time and attention, often neglecting your own needs and comfort in the process.
                        These cords or energy connections can be severed between two people to bring more stability and harmony into life, fostering a sense of peace, freedom, and completeness.</p>

                    <span>A healthy and positive cord will give you stability and peace in your life making sure that you are taking care of yourself </span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You are desperately wishing you could help someone.</li>
                        <li>You are afraid about being inadequate to a task or event.</li>
                        <li>Your system is overwhelmed by an assault, so it cannot properly process and resolve it.</li>
                        <li>Someone is continuously thinking of you sending positive or negative vibes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>How the cords connect between two people:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The ones you throw because you are trying to help them.</li>
                        <li>The ones they grab at you with to get something from you.</li>
                        <li>The ones you throw because you feel overwhelmed and hurt by them.</li>
                        <li>The ones they throw at you because they have been trying to avoid some of their own
                            baggage by taking it out on you.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="fw-bold">Let us explore types of cords that can affect your energy system:</p>
                    <h5 class="first_subheading" style="color: #DF8170;">A. Energy cords </h5>
                    <p>These are physical structures made of energy. They can be visualized as tubes that connect
                        people. If the cord is depleting someone, the energy flows away from them. If the cord is
                        feeding someone, the energy flows toward them.</p>
                    <h5 class="first_subheading" style="color: #DF8170;">B.Etheric cords: </h5>
                    <p>These are cords that can be cut to banish an ex, relieve anxiety, and relieve stress.</p>
                    <h5 class="first_subheading" style="color: #DF8170;">C. Cords of attachment or dependency </h5>
                    <p>These are physical structures made of energy. Cords of attachment are invisible bonds that
                        connect people together in the spiritual realm. They are energy structures that cause
                        patterns from the past to continue in the present moment. Cords of attachment can be form
                        with: Family, Friends, Co-workers, Acquaintances, Romantic relationships.</p>
                    <p>Cords of attachment are connected to one or more chakras of both people. The specific chakra
                        they are rooted in depends on the thought and emotional frequency you share with that
                        person.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It is important to note here that the concept of energetic cords is a belief that exists in
                        some spiritual and energy healing traditions but is not yet universally accepted or
                        supported by scientific evidence. The effectiveness and significance of cord cutting and
                        related practices are matters of personal belief and interpretation. Individuals who are
                        interested in exploring these concepts should do so with an open mind and consider
                        consulting with experienced practitioners or mentors in the field.</p>

                    <h5 class="first_subheading" style="color: #86C767;">Cord Cutting </h5>
                    <p>Though it is advisable to take help of a trained practitioner to cut cords properly for
                        sustainability, you may also experience practicing the same. To practice cutting cords with
                        someone
                        and release emotional attachments, you can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sit in a peaceful, quiet place, and close your eyes.</li>
                        <li>Slow your breathing and get into a meditative state.</li>
                        <li>Invite in any type of guide you believe in.</li>
                        <li>Imagine the cord that connects you to the person whom you wish to be released from.</li>
                        <li>Visualize yourself holding a pair of scissors and cutting the cord, letting the
                            connection fade
                            back into darkness.Visualize yourself holding a pair of scissors and cutting the cord,
                            letting

                    <p>Emotional management, also known as emotional regulation, refers to the ability to recognize, understand, and effectively manage one's own emotions in various situations. It's a crucial skill for maintaining emotional well-being, fostering healthy relationships, and making sound decisions. Emotional management is a type of therapy that helps people better understand, accept, regulate, and express emotions.
                        Human beings naturally give more weight to negative emotions than positive ones, a phenomenon known as negativity bias. Negative emotions tend to carry a significant impact, whereas positive feelings are often subtler. Developing a habit of noticing these positive experiences may boost resilience and overall well-being.
                        In emotional management, individuals learn constructive ways to respond to both positive and negative stimuli. We assist them in becoming aware that it's healthy to express their feelings, emphasizing the importance of how and when they express them.

                    <p>Grief is a natural and complex emotional response to loss, and it can affect individuals in
                        various
                        ways. Managing grief involves coping with the intense emotions, adjusting to life without
                        the person
                        or thing you've lost, and finding ways to move forward.

                        tips,
                        techniques and practices that help elevate pain and other emotions that surface along with
                        grief.
                        It's important to accept that grief is a part of your life. It may resurface at times,
                        particularly
                        during significant anniversaries or life events.</p>

                            cry,

                            them,
                            listing any questions you may have to talking positive about your loved ones to known

                            loved one

                    <p>Coping with a breakup can be challenging, involving a range of emotions such as sadness, anger, and grief. It is often one of the most difficult and emotionally painful processes in our lives. The loss of a boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, wife, or partner can feel like being torn apart, causing significant pain. Some individuals may even express suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm in the aftermath of a relationship ending, as they struggle to cope with the loss.
