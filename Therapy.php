                                Hypnotherapy is an alternative healing modality used by authorized health professionals to
                                induce a state of deep relaxation. It is a therapeutic psychotherapy approach that uses
                                hypnosis as a tool to help individuals address a wide range of psychological and emotional
                                issues. During hypnotherapy, a trained hypnotherapist guides the client  bringing his
                                conscious mind into a trance-like or hypnotic state in order to make the subconscious mind
                                more receptive to suggestions which can be used to alleviate pain, treat phobias, decrease
                                anxiety, improve dementia or sleep disorders, and to explore past memories.

                            <ul>
                                <li>Relieve extreme anxiety or phobias</li>
                                <li>Reduce pain in chronic conditions</li>

                            <h3 class="">How does Hypnotherapy work?</h3>
                            <p>Hypnosis helps by encouraging your body to use its natural relaxation response, triggered by
                                a phrase or nonverbal cue. This can lead to slowed breathing, lowered blood pressure, and an
                                improved sense of well-being.</p>
                            <h3 class="">Cons of hypnotherapy</h3>
                            <p>Cons of hypnotherapy
                                Hypnotherapy may also have some risks as there is a potential to create false memories
                                (called confabulations). Some other potential side effects may be headache, dizziness, and
                                anxiety. However, these usually fade shortly after the hypnotherapy session.
                                Hypnotherapy may not be the best modality for people suffering from delusions,
                                hallucinations, or other psychotic symptoms. They are advised to first consult their doctor
                                or psychiatrist as it is possible that hypnotherapy could worsen symptoms.
                            </p>
                            <p> Hypnotherapy is not a quick fix. Though there are many recorded cases in which only one
                                session eliminated a lifelong allergy or released chronic neck pain, it is not the norm.  In
                                most cases, 4 to 6 sessions are needed for the full effects of hypnotherapy to create last
                                healing and change. In the case of chronic disease, you may find that 12 to 24 sessions are
                                necessary for lasting change.

                            <h3 class="">Self-hypnosis</h3>
                            <p>All hypnosis is self-hypnosis. You are in control of your hypnotic state in each moment. You
                                can choose to explore your subconscious and the images, sensations, and memories there or
                                you can choose to open your eyes and return to the room at any time.</p>
                            <h3 class="">Important Tips regarding Hypnotherapy: </h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Hypnotherapy cannot be done to you. Hypnosis will not work if you are not willing, wanting it, and focused on healing. The hypnotherapist can only guide you.</li>
                                <li>You are responsible for participating fully, dedicating the time and space needed, and practicing self-hypnosis.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>What is said in any hypnagogic state, if accepted willingly by your subconscious, can have a major effect on your life. Imagine the dramatic changes if you no longer felt unworthy or were no longer driven to seek others' approval all the time. Conversely, consider the impact if you believed that nothing could help you. The power of suggestion in this state can profoundly influence your perceptions and behaviors. Hypnotherapy is often used in conjunction with other therapeutic approaches and is not typically a stand-alone treatment for severe mental health conditions.</p>

                                <li> Are you curious about off-planet lifetimes or other dimensions? </li>
                                <li>Have you experienced déjà vu, visiting a place for the first time, yet finding it familiar or feeling at home? </li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Past life regression therapy is an alternative form of therapy that seeks to explore and potentially resolve issues or challenges in an individual's current life by accessing and revisiting what is believed to be their past lives. Rooted in the concept of reincarnation, a belief found in various spiritual and religious traditions, this therapeutic approach employs hypnosis to recover memories of past lives or incarnations.</p>

                            <p>It's important to note that the practice is widely considered discredited and unscientific by medical practitioners. However, for those interested, a past life regression session typically begins with the therapist asking the client to make a list of their issues or experiences that need addressing. These could be fears, hurts, or perplexing relationships. The session may also involve exploring life's purpose or addressing energies attached to the individual, such as a loved one from a past life that seems to linger, creating challenges in the present. Despite varying perspectives on its validity, for those who undergo it, past life regression can be a profound and insightful experience.</p>
                            <p>It uses hypnosis to recover what practitioners believe are memories of past
                                lives or incarnations. The practice is widely considered discredited and unscientific by medical
                                practitioners. What does a past life regression session entail?
                                It is helpful to know what needs addressing so the therapist may ask the client to make a list
                                of their issues or experiences that they need addressed. It might be a fear, a hurt, or a
                                painful relationship they don't understand. Or, maybe they just want an insight and are looking
                                to explore their life's purpose.
                                Sometimes, people have energies attached to them that are not their own and are creating
                                problems, the same may need clearing. For example, a loved one from a past life that won’t let
                                them go. It can be a profound experience for the person who may be unknowingly following their
                                traits.</p>

                            <p>Soul Retrieval, also called Soul Hunting, is a concept and practice found in various indigenous and shamanic belief systems. It is based on the idea that, under certain circumstances, a person's soul or essence may become fragmented or dissociated, leading to spiritual and emotionalimbalances. Soul retrieval is a healing process aimed at recovering and reintegrating these lost or fragmented parts of the soul. The process involves journeying into the spirit world with the help of a spirit guide to witness the trauma, track the lost soul part, communicate and convince it to return, and retrieve and reintegrate it back into the energy body to return to wholeness.
                                The effects of having a soul retrieval vary from person to person. Some people feel that they are more grounded in their body and feel more solid, full, happy, content, and courageous, ready to pursue their lives. Some feel lighter and a joyful way of being returns to them.

                            <p>How can you tell if you have suffered a soul loss? 
                                You may feel detached, empty, devoid of purpose, unable to concentrate, and aimless in life. Some individuals may experience deep depression and have suicidal thoughts. Many simply suffer memory loss of crucial years from early childhood.
                                Sometimes, the lost part is stuck back in the time period and place of the trauma. Other times, the soul part drifts further and literally goes off into realms beyond this one. Sometimes, these lost parts may flee to safe places in other realms, while other times, they may gravitate to places of hopelessness and despair. What these lost soul parts need, and what the person they belong to needs, is to come back. This is where soul retrieval comes in.
